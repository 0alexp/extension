# /api/indexing

The indexing directory contains all code related to "application-level indexing"
â€” things like fungible token balances and NFTs, as well as more abstract
application concepts like governance proposals.

`indexing` maintains its own data, separate from lower-level chain state
information like blocks and transactions.
